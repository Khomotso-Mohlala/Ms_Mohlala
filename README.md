This repository contains code and analyses for my Honours project, **“Patterns of HPV Co-Infection, Persistence, and Infection Trajectories in South African Women.”**  
The study investigates **HPV genotype co-infections and infection trajectories** using longitudinal cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from young women enrolled in the **FRESH cohort (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa)** — a **pre-vaccine cohort**.

### 📖 Study significance
This work provides **baseline HPV genotype data** that can serve as a foundation for understanding **HPV vaccine efficacy** in a population with a high burden of HPV.  
Findings from this project aim to **inform vaccine policy decisions** in South Africa and highlight the need for **broader vaccine coverage** targeting the most prevalent genotypes circulating in this region.

## 🧩 Project objectives
1. **Objective 1:** To determine the prevalence of multi-type HPV infections and identify which types tend to co-occur.
2. **Objective 2:** To assess the prevalence and patterns of co-persistent HPV infections.
3. **Objective 3:** To classify individuals into distinct longitudinal infection trajectories.

## ⚙️ Tools and programming environment
This project was developed primarily in **R**, using:
- **tidyverse** (data wrangling and visualization)  
- **janitor** (data cleaning)  
- **lubridate** (date handling)  
- **ggplot2** (figure generation)  
- **kableExtra** (publication-style tables)  
- **dplyr**, **readr**, and other supporting R packages  

Scripts were executed using **RStudio** on both a **local Windows environment**
